# competitive-programming-answers
I am a new competitive programmer (though I've been programming for quite a few years now) and I needed a place to archive my answers and perhaps my answers might help anyone understand how to solve that problem, I also try to add useful comments to my new code

Best of luck solving, everyone :D
